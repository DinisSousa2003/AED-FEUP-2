# How to navigate STCP, Porto's bus service

## Description

Navigating Porto's dense and vast bus service network is not easy, and students like us, who use the line daily know that better than anyone! For this project, we were given the lists of bus stops in Porto and their locations, and we developed a terminal-based program that provides the fastest route from any given area or station to any other. Using graph algorithms learned in class, we optimized paths for time, number of stops, line changes and zones traversed (to save some money). It supports both foot and bus travelling. Developed in C++
